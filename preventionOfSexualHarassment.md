## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

### Stay Safe
- Prioritize your safety and the safety of others. If you witness an incident, assess the situation and ensure your safety before taking any action.

### Speak Up (if you can) 
- If you feel safe and comfortable doing so, speak up and address the behavior directly. Clearly and firmly tell the harasser that their actions are inappropriate and unwelcome. Sometimes, a direct response can deter further harassment.

### Document the Incident 
- If you experience or witness harassment, make notes about what happened, when and where it occurred, and who else was present. Documentation can be valuable if you decide to report the incident later.

### Support the Victim 
- If you witness someone being harassed, offer your support and let them know you are there to help. Be a compassionate listener and encourage them to report the incident if they are willing to do so.

### Report the Incident 
- If you are comfortable doing so, report the incident to the appropriate authority or supervisor in your workplace, school, or community. Follow the established reporting procedures and ensure your complaint is documented.

### Encourage Others to Report 
- If you witness repeated incidents of sexual harassment or notice a pattern, encourage others who may have experienced similar behavior to come forward and report the incidents.

### Seek Support 
- If you are affected by witnessing or experiencing harassment, don't hesitate to seek emotional support from friends, family, or professional counselors. Talking about your feelings can be helpful in coping with the situation.

### Know Your Rights 
- Familiarize yourself with the laws and policies related to sexual harassment in your jurisdiction. Knowing your rights can empower you to take appropriate action.

### Engage Bystander Intervention
- If you witness harassment happening to someone else, consider using bystander intervention techniques to de-escalate the situation or create a distraction to help the person being targeted.

### Contact HR or Authority Figures 
- If the harassment occurs in the workplace or educational setting, contact the Human Resources department or relevant authority figures to initiate an official investigation.

### Report Online Harassment 
- For instances of online harassment, report the offensive content to the platform's administrators and block the harasser.
