# Listening and Active Communication

## 1. Active Listening

### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

1. **Pay attention.**
    * Give the speaker your full attention, both verbally and nonverbally.
    * Make eye contact, lean in slightly, and avoid distractions such as your phone or computer.
2. **Show that you're listening.**
    * Nod your head, make eye contact, and use other nonverbal cues to show that you're following what the speaker is saying.
    * Ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand.
3. **Paraphrase what the speaker has said.**
    * This is a great way to show that you're listening and to ensure that you've understood the speaker correctly.
    * You can simply repeat what the speaker has said in your own words, or you can summarize the main points.
4. **Ask open-ended questions.**
    * This will help you to get more information from the speaker and to better understand their perspective.
    * Avoid asking yes or no questions, as these will only limit the conversation.
5. **Reflect the speaker's feelings.**
    * This means letting the speaker know that you understand their emotions.
    * You can do this by using phrases such as "I can see that you're feeling frustrated" or "It sounds like you're feeling hurt."
6. **Summarize the conversation.**
    * This is a good way to end the conversation and to ensure that you and the speaker are on the same page.
    * You can simply summarize the main points of the conversation, or you can ask the speaker if they have any final thoughts.

### Tips
